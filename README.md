# COSC6397-MRTK
MRTK Assignment for COSC 6397

Purpose: to develop an application using atleast (2) features from MRTK

In this application, I implemented:

- an **object collection** in order to lay out an array of cubes in a 3-d array dimensional shape.
- an **object manipulator** in order to make a cube moveable, scalable and rotatable using one or two hands.
- a **bounding box** to make a cube interactable by handling the corners and edges of the cube to allow for scaling or rotation.
